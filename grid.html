            <p align="justify">
                Formula 1 is a sport in which overtaking is difficult, and track position is of utmost importance.
                The F1 grid refers to the formation of each driver's starting position at the beginning of the race.
                Where a driver starts on the grid can significangtly impact where they finish the race,so ensuring a favorable grid position is a part of any succesful race strategy.<br />

            <p>
                A points system is used at Grands Prix to determine two annual World Championships: one for the drivers, and one for the constructors (the teams).
                Each driver must hold a valid Super Licence, the highest class of racing licence issued by the FIA, and the races must be held on tracks graded "1", the highest grade-rating issued by the FIA for tracks
            </p>
            <p>Formula One cars are the fastest regulated road-course racing cars in the world, owing to very high cornering speeds achieved through the generation of large amounts of aerodynamic downforce. Much of this downforce is generated by front and rear wings, which have the side effect of causing severe turbulence behind each car. The turbulence reduces the downforce generated by the cars following directly behind, making it hard to overtake. </p>
            <p>Major changes made to the cars for the 2022 season has seen greater use of ground effect aerodynamics and modified wings to reduce the turbulence behind the cars, with the goal of making overtaking easier. The cars are dependent on electronics, aerodynamics, suspension and tyres. Traction control, launch control, and automatic shifting, plus other electronic driving aids, were first banned in 1994. They were briefly reintroduced in 2001, and have more recently been banned since 2004 and 2008, respectively.</p>
